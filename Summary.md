## Chapter Summary: Foundational Principles of Linguistics

This chapter explores the foundational principles of linguistics, with a focus on **language as part of a broader semiotic system**—a system of communication that includes not only human language, but also **gesture, art, music, and dress**. It outlines the **structure of language**, including:

- Modes of communication (speech, writing, signs)
- Conventions (linguistic and social rules)

Key Topics

### Unconscious Linguistic Knowledge
- Native speakers know rules of grammar and politeness **without formal instruction**.
- Example: *beautiful day* (correct) vs. *day beautiful* (incorrect in English).

### Scientific Study of Language
- Linguists aim for **objective analysis**, but even scientific views can be shaped by **ideological biases**

### Theories of Grammar
- Introduces two key linguistic theories:
  - **Chomsky’s Generative Grammar** – language as a mental structure.
  - **Halliday’s Functional Grammar** – language as a tool for social function.
