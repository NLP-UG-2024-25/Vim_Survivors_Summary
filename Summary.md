# Vim Survivors Summary

Welcome to the **Vim Survivors Summary** project!

---

## Introduction

This chapter explores the foundational principles of linguistics, with a focus on **language as part of a broader semiotic system** - a system of communication that includes not only human language, but also **gesture, art, music, and dress**. It outlines the **structure of language**, including:

- Modes of communication (speech, writing, signs)
- Conventions (linguistic and social rules)

---

## Key Topics

### Unconscious Linguistic Knowledge
- Native speakers know rules of grammar and politeness **without formal instruction**.
- Example: *beautiful day* (correct) vs. *day beautiful* (incorrect in English).

### Scientific Study of Language
- Linguists aim for **objective analysis**, but even scientific views can be shaped by **ideological biases**

### Theories of Grammar
- Introduces two key linguistic theories:
  - **Chomsky’s Generative Grammar** - language as a mental structure.
  - **Halliday’s Functional Grammar** - language as a tool for social function.

---

## Interaction of Semiotic Systems

- **Reinforcement**: Gestures can support verbal language (e.g., pointing while saying "Put it there").
- **Paralinguistic Gestures**: Some gestures work independently of language (e.g., President Bush looking at his watch = boredom).

---

## Nature of Linguistic Signs

- **Arbitrariness**: Most signs have **no inherent connection** to their meaning.
  - Example: *window* could be *krod* - it's arbitrary.
- **Iconicity** (limited cases):
  - Sound imitates meaning: *buzz*, *moo*, *loooong*
- **Phonesthemes**: Sounds with meaning tendencies, like *-sh* in *crash*, *bash*, *slash*.

---

## Cross-Linguistic Variation

- Onomatopoeic and iconic words differ across languages.
- While some words are iconic, most signs remain **arbitrary across languages**.

---

# The modes of language

## 1. Three primary modes

Signifiers are transmitted in human language through the following modes:

- **Speech**: Primary in linguistics.
- **Writing**: Secondary in linguistics.
- **Signing**: System of communication used by individuals who are deaf.

---

## 2. Linguistics

In linguistics, speech is seen as primary because all languages are spoken (unless they're dead, like Latin), while only some are written. 
*Example*: Kids naturally learn to speak but need formal education to read and write. 
However, calling speech "primary" can wrongly make writing seem less important. In reality, speech and writing serve different but **complementary purposes** - like how written contracts are preferred over oral ones due to their permanence and clarity in legal disputes.

---

## 3. Speech vs. Writing

### **Speech**: Contexts and Advantages

- **Preferred in interactive, real-time settings**:
  - Casual chats, business transactions, classroom discussions.

- **Key features**:
  - Immediate feedback: questions and clarifications happen on the spot.
  - Visual cues: facial expressions, body language.
  - Intonation adds emotion and emphasis (e.g., sarcasm, excitement).
  - Produced "on-line" - spontaneous and fast.

### **Writing**: Contrast with Speech:

- **Lacks immediacy** - no instant feedback or reaction.
- **Emotion and emphasis** limited to punctuation and formatting.
- Requires **planning**, **editing**, and **time** - more deliberate and polished.

---

## 4. The Overlap Between Spoken and Written Language

- People usually prefer **face-to-face interaction** over writing when they want a **casual** or **intimate** moment - it feels more immediate and personal.
- **Instant messaging** is a hybrid: it's fast like speech but still written. It can simulate a conversation, especially over long distances, but it still lacks full intimacy and spontaneity.

---

## 5. Interactivity Beyond the Speech-Writing Divide

- Speech is generally more interactive, but not all spoken forms are equal:
  - Phone calls and face-to-face chats are rich in **interactive features**: personal pronouns ("I", "you"), contractions, verbs like "think" and "feel."
  - Speeches, interviews, and broadcasts, though spoken, often feel more like written texts - **less personal**, **more structured**.

- Writing isn't always formal:
  - *Example*: Personal letters can be **interactive** - sometimes even more so than some spoken forms.

---

# Studying Linguistic Structure

## 1. The Structure of Language

Language (spoken, written, or signed) has an internal structure that can be studied through:

- **Rules**:
  - Define how we pronounce words, form them, arrange them into sentences, and interpret their meaning.
  - Studied under **grammar**.

- **Principles**:
  - Govern the appropriate use of language in different social and communicative contexts.
  - Studied under **pragmatics**.

### Key Insight:
Understanding language requires examining both **formal rules** (grammar) and **contextual principles** (pragmatics).

---

## 2. Linguistic Competence vs. Prescriptive Rules

- **Linguistic competence**: Internalized, unconscious knowledge of language rules (how native speakers actually speak).
- **Prescriptive rules**: Learned, often taught rules (e.g., "Never split an infinitive") that may not reflect actual usage.

### Example:
- Child says: *"I broked it."*
  - Not standard English, but reveals:
    - Understanding of past tense formation.
    - Application of regular past tense rule (add -ed).
    - Mistake shows development of internal grammar, not ignorance.

---

## 3. Levels of Linguistic Structure

### **Phonetics and Phonology** (Sound)

- Focus on **phonemes** - smallest units of sound that distinguish meaning.
- Example:
  - Past tense pronunciation:
    - *Walked* → /t/ (voiceless following voiceless consonant)
    - *Killed* → /d/ (voiced following voiced consonant)
    - *Hunted* → /ɪd/ (following /t/ or /d/)

### **Morphology** (Word Structure)

- Focus on **morphemes** - smallest units of meaning.
- Types:
  - Free morphemes (e.g., *I*, *me*).
  - Bound morphemes (e.g., plural *-s*, past tense *-ed*).
- Rules for how words are built:
  - *Un-* + *happy* = *unhappy*
  - *I* is subject form; *me* is object form.

### **Syntax** (Sentence Structure)

- Concerns how words combine into phrases and sentences.
- Example:
  - *"I broked it"* = Subject (I), Predicate (broked), Object (it)
  - English is an **SVO** language: Subject–Verb–Object order.

### **Semantics** (Meaning)

- Studies how meaning is constructed:
  - Across sound, word, and sentence levels.
  - Changing a phoneme (e.g., *kick* → *sick*) changes meaning.
  - Word order affects meaning: *Jose wrote to Carla* ≠ *Carla wrote to Jose*.
  - Morphemes change meaning: *happy* → *unhappy*.
  - Deixis (context-based meaning): *I*, *you*, *here*, *now*.

---

## 4. Grammar vs. Pragmatics

### Grammar:
- Rule-governed system for forming words, phrases, and sentences.
- Examples:
  - Past tense: *walk* → *walked*
  - Case: *I* (subject) vs. *me* (object)

### Pragmatics:
- How language is used in context to achieve goals.
- Factors include age, power, familiarity, politeness, etc.

### Example:
- *"I broked it"* might be accepted when said by a child.
  - Grammatical: Shows internalized rules.
  - Pragmatic: Acceptable due to speaker's age and context.

---

## 5. Text and Discourse Structure

### Text:
- Language used in larger units (beyond the sentence) - e.g., stories, conversations, essays.

### Cohesion:
- Linguistic devices that tie parts of text together.
  - Pronouns: *"That's okay"* → "That" refers back to previous sentence.
  - Conjunctions, ellipsis, referencing.

### Coherence:
- Logical connection and overall sense.
- Achieved through:
  - Cohesion.
  - Shared cultural and contextual understanding.

---

## 6. Rules vs. Principles

- **Rules**: Strict linguistic constraints.
  - Example: Imperative sentences → *"Tell me how to get there."*

- **Principles**: Flexible, social or cultural guidelines.
  - That same imperative may sound rude in certain contexts (e.g., to a stranger).
  - Politeness strategies (e.g., *"Could you please...?"*) often replace direct commands.

---

## 7. Grammaticality vs. Acceptability

### Grammaticality:
- Whether a sentence follows linguistic rules of a language.
- Judged independently of social or contextual factors.

### Acceptability:
- Whether a sentence is considered appropriate or natural in a given context.
- Influenced by:
  - Dialect
  - Context
  - Speaker identity
  - Social norms

### Examples:
| Sentence                        | Grammatical | Acceptable |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| "I don't have any money."     | Yes         | Yes        |
| "I ain't got no money."       | Yes (in some dialects) | Depends on context |
| "Have I don't money any."     | No          | No         |

# Language and Ideology

## 1. Prescriptivism vs. Descriptivism in Linguistics

### Prescriptivism
- Belief in fixed, correct language rules.
- Aims to **prescribe** how people *should* speak and write.
- Associated with **reactionary views**, linguistic nostalgia, and elitism.
- Example: John Simon condemns language change, calling descriptive linguists a "curse."

### Descriptivism
- Objective observation of how language is actually used.
- Avoids value judgments.
- Example: Jean Aitchison argues that language change is **natural** and **inevitable**.

---

## 2. Linguistic Ideologies in Conflict

### John Simon (Reactionary Prescriptivist)
- Believes language is decaying.
- Associates correctness with educated elites.
- Views popular/"uneducated" usage as linguistic decline.

### Jean Aitchison (Descriptivist)
- Criticizes puristic nostalgia for a mythical "perfect" past form of language.
- Emphasizes the **logical inconsistency** of trying to freeze language.

---

## 3. Verbal Hygiene

- Term by **Deborah Cameron**: refers to efforts (by both experts and laypeople) to define "good" or "bad" language.
- Both prescriptivists and descriptivists engage in verbal hygiene, though from different perspectives.

---

## 4. Informed vs. Reactionary Prescriptivism

### Reactionary Prescriptivists
- Emotionally charged.
- Offer little to constructive language discussion.
- Example: Simon's elitist divide between "educated" vs. "uneducated."

### Informed Prescriptivists
- Can contribute positively in:
  - Language policy.
  - Education.
  - Public discourse.
- Recognize that **language norms evolve** but still have communicative and social value.

---

## 5. Gender and Language Change

### Grammatical vs. Natural Gender
- **Old English**: grammatical gender (arbitrary).
  - e.g., *hand* (masculine), *pride* (feminine), *body* (neuter).
- **Modern English**: natural gender based on biological sex.
  - Pronouns and some job titles reflect this.

### Gender-Neutral Language
- Shift from *mailman*, *stewardess* → *mail carrier*, *flight attendant*.
- Often labeled as "politically correct" but has strong **linguistic motivations**.
- Informed prescriptivism can clarify this linguistic rationale.

---

## 6. Teaching Implications

### Standard English vs. Non-standard Dialects
- Example: African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
  - Rule of **copula deletion** (e.g., *He late*).
- Teachers with linguistic training:
  - Better understand student language.
  - Can bridge dialects and standard forms.
  - Avoid mislabeling dialect features as "errors."

---

## 7. Critiques of Linguistics

- Linguists are often accused of "anything goes" attitudes.
- However, they do not promote chaos:
  - They seek to explain how language *actually works*.
  - They support informed decision-making in language use and policy.

---

# Theorizing About Language

## 1. Diverse Linguistic Theories

- Linguists have varying ideological views about language.  
- Three main emphases:  
  - **Competence-based theories**: Language as a mental property.  
  - **Performance-based theories**: Language as social use.  
  - **Combined theories**: Language as both mental and social product.

---

## 2. Noam Chomsky and Competence-Based Linguistics

- Noam Chomsky pioneered generative grammar in the 1950s.  
- He argued for an innate language faculty - **universal grammar** - shared across all humans.  
- Challenged behaviorism by showing children produce novel sentences beyond their experience.  
- Focused on what languages have in common rather than their differences.

---

## 3. Generative Grammar and Linguistic Creativity

- It's a formal system that describes what we know about language.  
- From a finite set of rules, we can create infinite sentences - key idea: **creativity**.  
- Creativity is seen as a defining feature of human language.  
- This theory revolutionized linguistics and influenced related fields (philosophy, psychology).

---

## 4. Limitations of Competence-Only Models

- This approach concentrates on abstract syntactic structures, usually up to the sentence level.  
- Generally ignores actual language use or **performance**, treating it as error-prone or irrelevant.  
- Many linguists argue that ignoring social context and usage limits understanding.

---

## 5. Halliday's Systemic/Functional Grammar: Combining Competence and Performance

Michael Halliday developed a model integrating both competence and performance.  

- He views language primarily as a communicative tool.  
- According to him, there are three "metafunctions" of language:  
  - **1. Ideational**: Expressing experiences and realities via:  
    - *Material processes* (doing actions),  
    - *Mental processes* (inner experiences),  
    - *Relational processes* (classifying, relating).  
  - **2. Interpersonal**: Language in social interactions; shaped by roles like age, gender, education.  
  - **3. Textual**: Organizing coherent texts using structure and cohesion (e.g., logical connectors like "therefore").

---

## 6. Social and Linguistic Contexts in Language Use

- How we use language depends on social factors like age, gender, and education.  
- Texts have structural unity (e.g., headlines, leads) and cohesion (e.g., connective words like "therefore").  
- Functional view highlights how language "does something" within contexts, not just isolated sentences.  
- Effective communication depends on both linguistic and social context.

---

# Conclusions

## 1. Diverse Theoretical Perspectives in Linguistics

- Linguists **share core assumptions** about what language is.
- However, they differ in **theoretical approaches** to studying it.

---

## 2. Chomskyan Perspective: Language as Mental Competence

- Influenced by **Noam Chomsky**:
  - Views language as a **product of the human mind**.
  - Focus is on **linguistic competence**:
    - The **unconscious, internalized knowledge** of language rules.
    - Emphasis on what speakers "know" rather than what they "do."

- Goal:
  - Understand **underlying mental grammar**.
  - Study language **independently of its use in society**.

---

## 3. Broader Perspective: Language in Social and Textual Contexts

- Some linguists adopt a **more expansive view**:
  - Language should be studied in **real-world, social contexts**.
  - Includes:
    - **Textual structure** (how sentences combine to form meaningful discourse).
    - **Social use** of language in context.

- Emphasizes:
  - How people actually **use language** in different settings.
  - The **structure of communication** beyond isolated sentences.

---

## 4. Focus of This Book

- The book adopts the **social and textual approach** to studying English.

### Key Features of the Approach:

- Recognizes that language is:
  - A **social phenomenon**.
  - Used in **contextualized texts**, not just isolated sentences.

- The approach covers:
  1. **History of the English language** and key concepts in **language change** (next chapter).
  2. The **social basis of English** - how language use reflects social structures.
  3. The **structure of texts** - how meaning is constructed across sentences.
  4. **Grammatical rules** - from:
     - Full sentences  
     - Down to **individual speech sounds** (phonemes, morphemes, etc.)
